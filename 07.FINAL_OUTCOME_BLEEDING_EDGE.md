# Final Outcome: Returning to the Bleeding Edge

## Clean Canary Re-Entry

After completing the Dev Channel re-baseline and Insider enrollment, the system was successfully returned to the Canary channel and updated to:

- **Windows 11 Pro Insider Preview**
- **Canary Channel**
- **Build 28020.1371**

This represents a clean, supported Canary baseline with full Insider entitlement restored.

## Post-Rebaseline Validation

Before reintroducing stress workloads, baseline validation was performed:

- Screenshot capture succeeded
- Images opened correctly in Photos and Paint
- Explorer image preview functioned
- Snipping Tool remained stable
- Desktop composition behaved normally

This confirmed that the imaging and media stack was functional on the clean baseline.

## Workload Reintroduction

After validation, advanced workloads were reintroduced:

- SD.Next launched successfully
- Multiple SDXL image generations completed
- A batch workload of 10 image generations executed
- GPU compute and CUDA workloads remained stable

Following these workloads:

- Screenshot capture continued to function
- Image viewing remained operational
- No immediate regression reappeared

This indicates the original failure was **stateful and cumulative**, not deterministic.

---

## What This Confirms

The investigation supports the following conclusions:

- The regression was not permanent
- The system was not corrupted
- Hardware and drivers were not at fault
- CFR and runtime state were the most likely triggers
- Re-baselining restored expected behavior

Most importantly, it confirms that **Canary behavior can diverge sharply based on runtime history**, even on identical builds.

## Back on the Bleeding Edge

The system is now:

- Properly enrolled in the Windows Insider Program
- Receiving Canary builds normally
- Operating with supported recovery paths
- Positioned again at the edge of platform experimentation

This outcome does not mean the issue is “fixed forever.”
It means the system is once again operating **as Canary is intended to operate**.

---

## Final Takeaway

Canary builds are not designed for stability.
They are designed to expose platform boundaries.

This investigation demonstrates how:

- Small surface symptoms can indicate deep platform shifts
- Experimental runtime state can persist across updates
- Re-baselining is sometimes the only way forward
- Working at the bleeding edge requires understanding recovery, not just failure

This repository remains a living case study of that reality.
