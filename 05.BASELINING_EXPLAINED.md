# Re-Baselining on Windows Insider Canary: What It Is and Why It Matters

## Overview

In the context of Windows Insider Canary builds, **re-baselining** does not mean repairing a damaged system or undoing configuration mistakes.

Re-baselining means **resetting the experimental runtime state of the operating system** to a known-good baseline so that Controlled Feature Rollout (CFR), Insider entitlement, and platform subsystems are brought back into alignment.

This document explains what re-baselining means in practice, why it was required in this investigation, and why traditional repair mechanisms are insufficient for Canary regressions.

## What “Baseline” Means in Canary

Microsoft treats Insider builds differently than released versions of Windows.

In Canary:

- The **primary build number** (e.g., 26200, 28020) represents a **platform baseline**
- Serviced updates (.xxxx suffixes) are cumulative changes on that baseline
- Features and behaviors may be enabled dynamically through **Controlled Feature Rollout (CFR)**
- Runtime state may persist across updates

A baseline is therefore more than a version number. It represents:

- A specific set of platform assumptions
- A clean alignment between OS binaries, runtime flags, and Insider entitlement
- A known starting point for experimentation

## Why Standard Repair Does Not Work

When a Canary regression occurs, common repair steps often fail:

- SFC and DISM report a healthy system
- Applications are installed and up to date
- Drivers load correctly
- The OS appears stable at rest

This happens because **CFR-driven regressions occur at runtime**, not at install time.

Re-baselining is required when:

- Experimental runtime paths are activated and persist
- Insider enrollment state becomes misaligned
- The system has no supported path to reconcile OS state with Insider backend state

In these cases, repairing files does nothing because the issue is not missing or corrupted binaries.

## Re-Baselining vs Reinstalling

Re-baselining is **not** the same as wiping the system.

A proper re-baseline:

- Preserves user data and applications
- Reinstalls the OS over itself
- Replays Insider enrollment and agreement acceptance
- Resets CFR and experimental runtime state
- Restores supported recovery paths

This investigation demonstrates a real-world scenario where **re-baselining was the only viable fix**.

## Key Takeaway

On Canary builds, **a healthy system at rest does not guarantee a healthy runtime state**.

When experimental features interact in unexpected ways, the only supported way forward may be to **reset the baseline itself**, not to repair the system layered on top of it.
