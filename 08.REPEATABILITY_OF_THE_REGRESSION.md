# Repeatability of the Imaging Stack Regression

This document establishes that the imaging stack regression documented in this repository is **repeatable** and **state-dependent**, not a one-off anomaly.

The purpose of this document is to demonstrate that the behavior follows a consistent pattern when the same class of workload is executed under comparable conditions on Windows 11 Insider Canary builds.

This is a post-resolution finding. The system was already restored to a clean Canary baseline prior to these observations.

## Scope

This document focuses on repeatability only.

It does not re-litigate:
- Root cause theory
- Canary or CFR background
- Recovery or re-baselining procedures

Those topics are documented elsewhere in this repository.

## Summary of Repeatable Behavior

Across multiple sessions on a clean Canary baseline, the regression reappears after executing workloads that share the following characteristics:

- SDXL-class inference workloads
- Long-lived CUDA contexts
- GPU passthrough via WSL2
- High VRAM and BAR1 pressure
- High prompt token density
- Non-canonical image resolutions
- Repeated transitions between compute and desktop usage

The system remains stable during inference and fails only after returning to routine desktop imaging tasks.

---

## Observed Trigger Sequence

The following sequence has been observed repeatedly:

1. Extended SDXL inference runs complete successfully
2. GPU utilization returns to idle
3. Desktop usage resumes
4. Screenshot capture or image viewing is attempted
5. Imaging tools fail immediately

This sequence has occurred more than once under the same workload profile.

## What Repeatability Confirms

Repeatability confirms that:

- The workload itself is valid
- Inference execution is not failing
- The failure is post-workload, not during compute
- The regression is stateful and cumulative
- The issue is not caused by configuration drift or user error

This behavior aligns with Canary experimentation affecting shared runtime paths rather than application-level logic.

---

## Why Repeatability Matters

Repeatability elevates this issue from anecdotal to investigable.

It enables:
- Meaningful comparison across Canary builds
- Validation by other advanced users
- Tracking of regression persistence over time
- Clear separation between transient glitches and systemic behavior

This is a defining property of a real platform regression.

## Current Status

At the time of writing:

- The regression is repeatable under the described workload class
- It is recoverable without re-baselining (see mitigation document)
- It is not deterministic on first occurrence
- It appears cumulative and state-driven

Future Canary updates may alter or eliminate this behavior. Until then, repeatability remains an important signal.
